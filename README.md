**Sheet-Loader**
================

Sheet-Loader is a REST API application designed to load data from Excel sheets into a Postgres database. Built using Spring Boot and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, this project provides a scalable and efficient solution for data migration.

**Endpoints**
------------

### `/upload/single`

Upload a single Excel file and dump its data into the Postgres database.

### `/upload/multiple` (TODO)

Upload multiple Excel files and dump their data into the database. (Coming soon!)

**Future Development**
--------------------

This project is ongoing, and additional endpoints will be developed to provide further functionality.
